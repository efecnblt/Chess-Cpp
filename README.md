# Chess-Game-With-C++
Chess C++
 This project, written in C++, encompasses fundamental object-oriented programming techniques. It handles the movement of all pieces according to their valid moves on the board. Additionally, it incorporates a simplistic implementation of the minimax algorithm. When prompted with the command 'Suggest', it evaluates and suggests moves for the current player that yield the highest possible score.
<p>NOTE!: This code can be written more neatly and cleanly.</p>

# Compile-And-Run
 To compile the file within a directory in Ubuntu, simply typing 'make' is sufficient.
  <p> <code> Make  </code></p>

# Save/Load file
 The game also includes the functionality to save the current game. When a user starts a new game, the current state of the game and the turn order are saved into two separate files. This allows the user to resume their game from where they left off when they re-enter the game.

# GAMEPLAY

 You can play the game by simply entering coordinates, just like in a traditional chess game ([e2e4], for example).
